IRCrypt â€“ Encryption Layer for IRC
==================================

*IMPORTANT: This is a working draft and not intended for usage yet!*

IRCrypt is intended to define an encryption layer for the IRC protocol defined
in [rfc1459]. The projects primary goals are:

1. Not to interfere with regular IRC. IRC is used as transport protocol, thus
   stays completely intact. IRCrypt should not cause any problems for regular
   clients.
2. To be easily adoptable, so that it can be adapted for and integrated into a
   wide range of clients quickly.
3. To be flexible in such a way that it supports a wide range of strong
   cryptographic ciphers.
4. To enable encryption and key exchange based on a web of trust.


OpenPGP
-------

IRCrypt neither defines custom cryptographic ciphers, nor a way how to use or
implement those ciphers. Instead it relies on the OpenPGP standard defined in
[rfc4880].

OpenPGP is implemented among other projects by the GNU privacy Guard [gnupg]
which can be used for message de- and encryption as well as managing the
web-of-trust. The first plug-ins to implement IRCrypt are based on GPG and it
is our recommendation to do the same if you want to build a plug-in for your
client.


IRCrypt Protocol Definition
---------------------------

To help IRCrypt grow a little bit faster, there exists a **lite version** and a
**full version** of IRCrypt. So some parts of the protocol are divided into the
definition of the lite version and the full version. The structure of the
protocol is as following:

1. **General protocol information**
2. **Symmetric Cipher**
3. **Asymmetric Cipher**
	1. Lite Version
	2. Full Version
4. **Key Exchange**
	1. Lite Version
	2. Full Version

Obviously **General protocol information** is important for every IRCRypt
implementation.  The main part of IRCrypt is to communicate encrypted in
channels with probably more than one other person. Because of that the part
**Symmetric Cipher** has to be part both in the lite version as well as in the
full version. In the lite version **Asymmetric Cipher** and **Key Exchange**
are not implemented, but there has to be a correct error treatment for incoming
messages encrypted with an asymmetric cipher and/or for key exchange requests,
so this error treatment is described in 3.1 and 4.1.
