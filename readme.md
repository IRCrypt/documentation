IRCrypt â€“ Encryption Layer for IRC
==================================

*IMPORTANT: This is a working dranft and not intended for usage yet!*

IRCrypt is intended to define an encryption layer for the IRC protocol defined
in [rfc1459]. The projects primary goals are:

1. Not to interfere with regular IRC. IRC is used as transport protocol, thus
   stays completely intact. IRCrypt should not cause any problems for regular
   clients.
2. To be easily adoptable, so that it can be adapted for and integrated into a
   wide range of clients quickly.
3. To be flexible in such a way that it supports a wide range of strong
   cryptographic ciphers.
4. To enable encryption and key exchange based on a web of trust.


OpenPGP
-------

IRCrypt neither defines custom cryptographic ciphers, nor a way how to use or
implement those ciphers. Instead it relies on the OpenPGP standard defined in
[rfc4880].

OpenPGP is implemented among other projects by the GNU privacy Guard [gnupg]
which can be used for message de- and encryption as well as managing the
web-of-trust. The first plug-ins to implement IRCrypt are based on GPG and it
is our recommendation to do the same if you want to build a plug-in for your
client.


IRCrypt Protocol Definition
---------------------------

The protocol definition for IRCrypt is divided into two separate parts:

1. Protocol definition for encrypted communication over IRC
    1. Usage of symmetric ciphers (i.e. AES or TWOFISH) for both private
       conversations and public channels.
    2. Usage of asymmetric ciphers (i.e. RSA) in private conversations
2. Protocol definition for key exchange using asymmetric ciphers (public key
   cryptography)

Part 1.ii and part 2 are optional parts, so that the protocol is satisfied if
only part 1.i is implemented, but there has to be a correct error treatment for
incomming messages encrypted with an asymmetric cipher and/or for key exchange 
requests if they are not implemented.
